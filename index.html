                <h2>About Me üë§</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Alex! I'm a Computer Science student passionate about web development. Currently, I'm diving into React and Bootstrap to expand my front-end skills, while also exploring the world of back-end development.</p>
                
                <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working in IT and fixing computers</li>
                    <li>Upgrading my gaming rig</li>
                    <li>Playing video games</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>I'm a self-starter who's not afraid to ask for help when learning something new. Right now, I'm excited about building a website for my mom's cleaning business, combining my love for web development with real-world application.</p>
