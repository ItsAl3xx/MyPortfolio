                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Alex Bravo! I'm passionate about technology, constantly learning, and always looking for new ways to challenge myself. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Information Technology at California State University-Dominguez Hills, I'm actively building my web development skills while leveraging my experience in IT support.
                        Over the past year, I've worked as an IT Help Desk Technician at my university, supporting over 1,000 students, faculty, and staff with technical issues ranging from connectivity problems to hardware malfunctions. My background in customer service, combined with a brief stint as a game tester at Riot Games, has given me strong problem-solving abilities and a user-focused mindset‚Äîqualities that I now apply to both IT support and web development.
                    </p>
                    
                    <!-- Professional background subsection -->
                    <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                    <!-- Paragraphs about IT Help Desk experience -->
                    <p>
                        With over a year of experience as an IT Help Desk Technician at California State University-Dominguez Hills, I've developed strong technical troubleshooting skills and a passion for delivering efficient, user-focused solutions. In this role, I provide comprehensive support to students, faculty, and staff, handling a wide range of technical issues, including hardware malfunctions, software glitches, and network connectivity problems. From resetting passwords and troubleshooting WiFi issues to more complex challenges, I ensure that users can stay connected and productive. When a solution requires more advanced intervention, I meticulously log tickets through ServiceNow to ensure timely resolution by the IT team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond remote support, I also offer on-site assistance, visiting offices across the university to address technology concerns and guarantee seamless day-to-day operations. My hands-on experience extends to re-imaging computers for both staff and faculty, ensuring that all devices are updated and functioning optimally. This role has not only enhanced my problem-solving abilities but also reinforced my commitment to delivering exceptional customer service, a skill I developed during my years working in retail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my IT experience, I had the opportunity to work with Riot Games as a game tester. Collaborating closely with the development team, I participated in playtest sessions, provided detailed feedback on bugs, and suggested user experience improvements. This gave me valuable insight into the development cycle and how user feedback can be crucial in refining digital products‚Äîa lesson I now apply to my web development work.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Career goals subsection -->
                    <h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently seeking IT positions where I can continue to build on my technical support expertise and problem-solving skills. With my hands-on experience in troubleshooting hardware and software issues, providing on-site support, and managing IT requests through ServiceNow, I'm confident in my ability to contribute to a fast-paced IT environment. I'm looking for opportunities that will allow me to work closely with teams, support end-users, and further develop my skills in IT infrastructure, system maintenance, and technical support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While I enjoy web development as a personal hobby and am continuously learning new tools and frameworks, my primary focus is on advancing my career in IT support roles, where I can make a direct impact and grow professionally.
                    </p>
